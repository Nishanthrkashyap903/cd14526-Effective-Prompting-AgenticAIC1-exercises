# Introduction to Prompting for LLM Reasoning and Planning

Before we get started on our course, let's take some time to set up and tidy our workspaces. As an agentic twist on the matter, we will guide a Large Language Model (LLM) through a series of prompt refinements to create a practical plan to organize your personal work area. In this hands-on exercise, you'll see how we move from a baseline prompt, then add a professional role to the AI, introduce concrete constraints like time and budget, and finally request step-by-step reasoning to generate a truly useful and tailored organization strategy for the rest of the course.
